GMetronome
==========

This application aims to be a practical and precise measurement tool for
composers and musicians in the daily practise routine. The functionality and
user experience is somewhat influenced by the now outdated GTick application
(https://antcom.de/gtick/) even though it does not share any code and was
written from scratch using up-to-date language features and technologies.

GMetronome is currently under heavy development. It is written for GNU/Linux
and other UN*X like operating system and utilizes the C++ language binding for
GTK 3 (https://gtkmm.org) with an upcoming transition to GTK 4 in mind.
